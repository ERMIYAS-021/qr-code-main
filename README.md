# My process

# Built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- CSS flexbox
- CSS media queries to make it responsive.

# What I learned:

Eventhough the project is a basic project, I learned a css root function to store various colors that we use in our project. I also practiced how to make responsive a webpage on small devices a little bit.
